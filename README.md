# HPC Notes

This repository provides a set of blueprints, notes, and code snippets for high-performance computing (HPC). The motivation behind this repository is to store and organize my own HPC workflows, tool and make them open source for others to use. The main content is a showcase of HPC tools, best practices, and their usage in applications. 

This place is not fixed, and will change & grow depending on my latest area of focus.
