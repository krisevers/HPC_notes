# Data Management

Data management in HPC involves organizing, storing, accessing, and moving large datasets efficiently to support computational workflows.

## Key Concepts

- **Data formats:** Standardized ways to store and exchange data.
- **Parallel I/O:** Reading/writing data using multiple processes for speed.
- **Metadata:** Descriptive information about datasets.
- **Data staging:** Moving data to/from compute nodes before/after jobs.
- **Data locality:** Placing data close to compute resources to reduce latency.
- **Checkpointing:** Saving application state for fault tolerance.
- **Compression:** Reducing data size for storage and transfer.
- **Replication:** Storing copies of data for reliability and performance.
- **Data provenance:** Tracking the origin and changes of data.
- **Access control:** Managing permissions and security for datasets.

## Tools & Libraries

- **HDF5 (.h5):** Hierarchical Data Format. 
    - widely used for scientific data.
    - Parallel HDF5 supports MPI I/O.
- **NetCDF:** Network Common Data Form.
    - popular in climate and geoscience.
- **ADIOS:** Adaptable IO System, optimized for HPC parallel I/O.
- **Zarr:** Chunked, compressed, N-dimensional arrays (cloud-friendly).
- **CSV/TSV:** Simple text formats, not efficient for large-scale HPC.
- **SQLite:** Lightweight embedded database, sometimes used for metadata.
- **DataLad:** Version control for large datasets.
- **DVC:** Data Version Control, integrates with Git.
- **tar/gzip/bzip2/xz:** Compression and archiving tools.

## Benchmarking

- **I/O throughput:** Data read/write speed (GB/s).
- **Latency:** Time to access or transfer data.
- **Scalability:** Performance as number of processes increases.
- **Metadata operations:** Speed of file/directory creation, lookup, etc.
- **Storage utilization:** Efficiency of space usage.
- **Data integrity:** Error rates, corruption checks.

### Benchmarking Tools

- **IOR:** Parallel I/O benchmarking tool.
- **mdtest:** Metadata performance testing.
- **fio:** Flexible I/O tester.
- **dd:** Simple disk throughput test.
- **Darshan:** HPC I/O characterization and profiling.
- **perf:** General performance profiling.
- **Custom scripts:** For workflow-specific data access patterns.
